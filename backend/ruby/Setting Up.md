Before we jump into Ruby, we must first set up our environment. In order to be able to write and execute Ruby scripts and programs, we must first have an updated version of Ruby installed.

Trainees using macOS will find that Ruby is installed by default on their machines. Linux users must install both the Ruby language and a Ruby version manager (we strongly recommend you use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), which also applies to macOS users). 

Please follow any of the following installation guides before continuing:

### macOS
